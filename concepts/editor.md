# OOP

By using OOP, instead of loading resources communicating with vRP through Proxy, extensions can directly be loaded into the vRP resource context. Each extension keeps its data and is able to access other extensions data and methods, making extending vRP easier, more powerful (we can access stuff even if not exposed) and with less overhead.

### Writing content

GitBook offers a range of block types for you to add to your content inline â€” from simple text and tables, to code blocks and more. These elements will make your pages more useful to readers, and offer extra information and context.

Either start typing below, or press `/` to see a list of the blocks you can insert into your page.
