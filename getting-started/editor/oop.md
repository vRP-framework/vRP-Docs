# OOP

vRP 2 Object-Oriented Programming uses the [Luaoop](https://github.com/ImagicTheCat/Luaoop) library.

{% hint style="info" %}
By using OOP, instead of loading resources communicating with vRP through Proxy, extensions can directly be loaded into the vRP resource context. Each extension keeps its data and is able to access other extensions data and methods, making extending vRP easier, more powerful (we can access stuff even if not exposed) and with less overhead.
